# TERRAFORM CONFIGURATION AND PROVIDER SETUP
# ================================================================================
# This configuration deploys a web server cluster with auto-scaling and a
# load balancer. It reads database connection details from the remote state
# stored by the MySQL RDS configuration in ../data-stores/mysql.

  # S3 BACKEND CONFIGURATION (PARTIAL - DRY APPROACH)
  # ================================================================================
  # UNCOMMENT WHEN READY FOR REMOTE STATE
  # This uses PARTIAL BACKEND CONFIGURATION to reduce copy-paste duplication.
  # The shared settings (bucket, region, dynamodb_table, encrypt) are defined
  # in the backend.hcl file at the project root.
  #
  # INITIALIZATION:
  # To initialize this module with the partial configuration, run:
  #   terraform init -backend-config=../../backend.hcl
  #
  # This approach:
  # ✓ Reduces duplication across modules
  # ✓ Makes it easy to change bucket/region in one place
  # ✓ Still allows unique 'key' for each module
  # ✓ Follows the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
  #
  # IMPORTANT: Only the 'key' is defined here. The other settings
  # (bucket, region, dynamodb_table, encrypt) come from backend.hcl
  #
  # The state file path mirrors the folder structure:
  # - This file: stage/services/webserver-cluster/main.tf
  # - State file: stage/services/webserver-cluster/terraform.tfstate
  # This creates a 1:1 mapping between code layout and state file location.
  #
  # backend "s3" {
  #   key = "stage/services/webserver-cluster/terraform.tfstate"
  # }
  # The other settings (bucket, region, dynamodb_table, encrypt)
  # are provided via -backend-config=../../backend.hcl when running terraform init

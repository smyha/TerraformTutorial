# Azure NAT Gateway Module - Variables
# ============================================================================
# Azure NAT Gateway provides outbound internet connectivity for virtual networks.
# It's a fully managed, highly resilient service that scales automatically.
#
# Key Features:
# - Outbound-only NAT (SNAT - Source Network Address Translation)
# - Up to 64,000 concurrent flows per public IP
# - Automatic scaling
# - No downtime during maintenance
# - Zone-redundant (Standard SKU)

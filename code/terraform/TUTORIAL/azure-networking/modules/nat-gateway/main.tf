# ============================================================================
# Azure NAT Gateway Module - Main Configuration
# ============================================================================
# NAT Gateway provides outbound internet connectivity for subnets.
#
# Architecture:
# VMs in Subnet (no public IPs)
#     ↓
# NAT Gateway (uses public IP)
#     ↓
# Internet
#
# Benefits over Load Balancer outbound rules:
# - Simpler configuration (no backend pools needed)
# - Better performance (up to 50 Gbps throughput)
# - More concurrent connections (64,000 per public IP)
# - No SNAT port exhaustion issues
# ============================================================================

# NAT Gateway
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# NAT Gateway provides outbound SNAT (Source Network Address Translation):
# - VMs without public IPs can access the internet
# - Uses the NAT Gateway's public IP as the source
# - Fully managed service (no VMs to manage)
# - Automatic scaling based on traffic
#
# Use Cases:
# - VMs need to download updates
# - VMs need to call external APIs
# - VMs need to access Azure services
# - Avoid SNAT port exhaustion (common with Load Balancer)
#
# Public IPs:
# - Each public IP supports up to 64,000 concurrent flows
# - Multiple public IPs can be added for more capacity
# - Public IPs must be Standard SKU
#
# Idle Timeout:
# - Default: 4 minutes
# - Range: 4-120 minutes
# - Longer timeout = fewer connection resets, but more resources used

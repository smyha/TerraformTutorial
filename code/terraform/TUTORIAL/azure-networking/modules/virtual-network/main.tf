# Azure Virtual Network Module - Main Configuration
# ============================================================================
# This module creates an Azure Virtual Network (VNet) with:
# - Virtual Network with configurable address spaces
# - Subnets with service endpoints and delegations
# - Optional DDoS Protection integration
# - Custom DNS server configuration
#
# Architecture:
# VNet (10.0.0.0/16)
#   ├── Subnet 1 (10.0.1.0/24) → Service Endpoints
#   ├── Subnet 2 (10.0.2.0/24) → Service Delegation
#   └── Subnet 3 (10.0.3.0/24) → Standard Subnet

# Virtual Network
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The VNet is the core networking component that provides:
# - Network isolation and segmentation
# - IP address space management
# - Subnet organization
# - DNS resolution
# - Optional DDoS protection
#
# Key Characteristics:
# - Logical isolation of Azure cloud resources
# - Each VNet has its own CIDR block
# - Can be linked to other VNets and on-premises networks
# - Address space cannot be changed after creation

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Subnets
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Subnets segment the VNet into smaller networks. Each subnet:
# - Must be within the VNet's address space
# - Cannot overlap with other subnets
# - Has 5 reserved IP addresses (network, gateway, 2x DNS, broadcast)
# - Can have service endpoints for Azure services (Storage, SQL, etc.)
# - Can be delegated to specific Azure services (e.g., AKS, App Service)
# - Can have network policies for private endpoints/private links
#
# Reserved Addresses per Subnet:
# - First address: Network address (e.g., 10.0.1.0)
# - Second address: Default gateway (e.g., 10.0.1.1)
# - Third and fourth: Azure DNS (e.g., 10.0.1.2, 10.0.1.3)
# - Last address: Broadcast address (e.g., 10.0.1.255)

# Route Tables (User-Defined Routes)
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Route Tables allow you to override Azure's default routing behavior.
# You can create custom routes to control how traffic flows in your VNet.
#
# Route tables can be associated with subnets to apply custom routing rules.
# Each subnet can have only one route table associated with it.
#
# Route Priority:
# - Routes are evaluated in order of specificity (most specific first)
# - System routes (default Azure routes) have lower priority than user-defined routes
# - If multiple routes match, the most specific route is used

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Routes (User-Defined Routes)
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Routes define how traffic is routed to specific destinations.
# Each route specifies:
# - Address prefix: Destination network (CIDR notation)
# - Next hop type: Where to send the traffic
# - Next hop IP: IP address (for VirtualAppliance next hop type)
#
# Next Hop Types:
# - VirtualAppliance: Route traffic through a Network Virtual Appliance (NVA)
# - VirtualNetworkGateway: Route traffic through VPN/ExpressRoute Gateway
# - VnetLocal: Route traffic within the VNet (default for VNet subnets)
# - Internet: Route traffic to the Internet
# - None: Drop traffic (blackhole route)
# - VnetPeering: Route traffic to a peered VNet
#
# Route Evaluation:
# - Routes are evaluated in order of specificity
# - Most specific route (smallest prefix) is matched first
# - If no user-defined route matches, system routes are used

# - All traffic from resources in that subnet uses the route table
# - User-defined routes override system routes for matching prefixes
# - Routes are evaluated in order of specificity

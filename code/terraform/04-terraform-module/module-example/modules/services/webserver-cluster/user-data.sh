# This file is used by `templatefile()` in the Terraform module. The module
# substitutes the variables `server_port`, `db_address`, and `db_port` into
# the template before passing it to the instance. The script writes a simple
# `index.html` and launches a tiny HTTP server (busybox httpd) that serves the
# file on the configured port.

# Note: This is intentionally minimal for educational purposes. Use cloud-init
# or more robust configuration management for production systems.

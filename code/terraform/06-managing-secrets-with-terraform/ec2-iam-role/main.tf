# This Terraform configuration demonstrates how to launch an EC2 instance with an attached IAM role and instance profile,
# granting the EC2 instance administrative privileges for EC2 resources ("ec2:*"). The setup includes:
# - Specifying the required Terraform and AWS provider versions.
# - Configuring the AWS provider to operate in the "us-east-2" region.
# - Creating a new aws_instance, specifying both its AMI and instance type.
# - Creating an IAM role, along with an associated policy document that allows EC2 to assume this role.
# - Attaching an inline policy granting full EC2 permissions to the role.
# - Generating an instance profile that is required for EC2 to use the IAM role.
# This example highlights the recommended practice of locking down instance metadata service (IMDS) access
# to enhance security after an instance boots (see Chapter 6).

# PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT: MySQL Database with Multi-Region Replication
# ============================================================================
# This configuration uses the mysql module (modules/data-stores/mysql) to deploy
# a highly available MySQL setup with:
#   - Primary database in us-east-2 (aws.primary provider)
#   - Read replica in us-west-1 (aws.replica provider) for disaster recovery
#
# COMPARISON WITH STAGING:
#   - Staging (live/stage/data-stores/mysql): Single instance, no replication
#     for cost optimization in pre-production environments
#   - Production (this file): Multi-region replication for high availability
#     and disaster recovery
#
# KEY FEATURES:
#   1. Provider aliases: Two AWS providers for different regions
#   2. Backup retention: Enabled (backup_retention_period = 1) to support replication
#   3. Replication: Replica automatically syncs from primary
#   4. High availability: If primary region fails, replica can be promoted
# ============================================================================

# ============================================================================
# MODULE: MySQL Primary Database

# This instance will have backups enabled (required for replication) and will
# serve as the source for the read replica in us-west-1.

# ============================================================================
# MODULE: MySQL Read Replica
# ============================================================================
# Creates a read replica of the primary database in us-west-1.
# The replica automatically syncs data from the primary and can be promoted
# to a standalone database if the primary region fails.
#
# Note: The module's conditional logic detects replicate_source_db is set,
# so it will NOT set engine, db_name, username, or password (those come from
# the primary). See modules/data-stores/mysql/main.tf for details.
